Concurrency
-----------
Approval locks the singleton ``revision_meta`` row (``SELECT ... FOR UPDATE``)
for the duration of the transaction.  Concurrent single approvals, batch
approvals, suspensions, resumptions, revocations and guard-band changes
therefore serialise on the same revision arbitration: losers re-adjudicate
against the winner's commit and are refused with ``stale_revision`` or
``interference``.  A batch either consumes one consecutive revision per
member in input order, or nothing at all; a guard-band change, a suspension
or a resumption consumes exactly one revision.

Temporary outages
-----------------
A suspension immediately removes an approved license from the effective set
without touching its original approval.  A resumption re-adjudicates the
license against the live guard band and all currently effective licenses; a
stale revision or renewed interference is refused (returning the current
revision or the conflicting licenses) while the license stays suspended and
no revision is consumed.  A suspended license may also be permanently
revoked with the ordinary revoke operation; a revoked license can never be
resumed.  Both operations append immutable events so historical snapshots
restore the suspended/effective status and the effective set at every
revision.

Guard band
----------
The live guard band is stored on the ``revision_meta`` row and seeded once
from the ``GUARD_BAND`` environment variable (restarts never overwrite it).
Every adjudication (preview, single/batch approval, resumption) uses the
live value; each confirmed change is appended as an immutable
``guard_band_events`` record so historical revision snapshots restore the
band in force at the time.  Approval and resumption events keep their own
copy of the band they were decided under and are never rewritten.

Waitlist
--------
A pending application may be registered as a standby while the band is
busy.  Registration and cancellation consume no revision and never change
the application's status; an application is queued at most once.  When a
suspension or a revoke releases an effective license, the same transaction
drains the queue in registration order: each entry is re-adjudicated under
the live guard band against the licenses effective so far (including the
automatic approvals just granted), passers are approved immediately and
consume the following consecutive revisions, blockers keep their place and
the drain continues.  A manual approval removes the queue entry first, so
a manually decided application is never auto-approved.  Every automatic
approval is an ordinary ``ApprovalEvent`` flagged ``auto_approved`` with the
release revision, which lets revision snapshots restore the automatic
decisions one revision at a time.

Restriction windows
-------------------
Operators temporarily control part of the spectrum with restriction
windows: a coverage circle, a closed frequency band and a half-open UTC
interval, plus a reason.  A read-only rehearsal preview lists the currently
effective licenses and standby applications the proposal would hit (and the
revision it is based on) without changing state; the confirmation carries
the expected revision, consumes one revision and activates the window.
Existing effective licenses that the window hits stay effective, but from
that revision onwards pending previews, single/batch approvals, suspended
license resumptions and post-release waitlist auto-approvals all report hit
windows, and no write may make a hit application effective.  A hit needs the
circle, half-open time and closed frequency band all to intersect (touching
band endpoints hit); the guard band never extends a window.  Releasing a
window by its id and the expected revision consumes another revision but
only affects later adjudication (it never auto-approves the waitlist).
Activations and releases are immutable events, so revision snapshots and
comparisons restore the windows active at the time; original approval
events are never rewritten.
